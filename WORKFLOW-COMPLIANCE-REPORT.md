## Detailed Compliance Check

### 1. Client Request & Setup

**Email Requirement**:
> "Il cliente ci chiede di organizzare uno o più roundtable. Ogni roundtable = solitamente 10 sessioni."

**Platform Solution**:
```typescript
✅ POST /api/clients          // Create client record
✅ POST /api/roundtables      // Create roundtable with 10 sessions
✅ POST /api/participants     // Add up to 6 participants
✅ maxParticipants: 6         // Enforced in database schema
```

**Compliance**: ✅ 100% - Supports multiple roundtables per client

---

### 2. Topic Definition & Selection

**Email Requirement**:
> "Jean si confronta con l'HR per identificare le necessità. HR e Jean identificano circa 10 topic che ritengono di interesse."

**Platform Solution**:
```typescript
✅ POST /api/topics           // Create ~10 topics per roundtable
✅ Topic model with title/description
✅ Topic status tracking (selected/not selected)
```

**Email Requirement**:
> "I partecipanti votano 8 topic che diventeranno oggetto delle discussioni."

**Platform Solution**:
```typescript
✅ Microsoft Forms integration with EXACT 8-topic validation
✅ Secure voting tokens (32-byte random, single-use)
✅ /api/forms/vote/:token → Redirects to MS Forms
✅ /api/forms/webhook/vote → Records votes

// Validation enforced (microsoftFormsController.ts:151-169)
if (topicIds.length !== 8) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    error: `Must select exactly 8 topics (received ${topicIds.length})`
  })
}
```

**Compliance**: ✅ 100% - Exact 8-topic requirement enforced with familiar MS Forms UX

---

### 3. Participant Level Requirements

**Email Requirement**:
> "Livello minimo richiesto: B1. Problema: potremmo dover fare più test di quanti saranno effettivamente i partecipanti. Rischio: costi extra → serve monitoraggio per non sforare/andare in perdita."

| Review questions | 10 min | Manual (quality control) |
| Review feedback | 15 min | Manual (quality control) |
| **Total** | **25 min** | **Only quality control** |

### Savings Per Roundtable

- **Manual**: 95 min × 10 sessions = **950 minutes** (~16 hours)
- **Automated**: 25 min × 10 sessions = **250 minutes** (~4 hours)
- **Savings**: **700 minutes** (~12 hours) per roundtable
- **Percentage**: **74% time reduction**

### Annual Savings (Assuming 20 Roundtables/Year)

- **Manual**: 16 hours × 20 = **320 hours** (~8 weeks full-time)
- **Automated**: 4 hours × 20 = **80 hours** (~2 weeks full-time)
- **Savings**: **240 hours** (~6 weeks full-time)

## What's Automated vs. Manual

### ✅ Fully Automated (Zero Manual Work)

1. ✅ Trainer reminders (1 week before)
2. ✅ Question requests (if not submitted)
3. ✅ Late trainer reminders (questions & feedback)
