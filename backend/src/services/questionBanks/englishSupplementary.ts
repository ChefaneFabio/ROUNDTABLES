Booth\'s seminal coinage in "The Rhetoric of Fiction" (1961). Booth distinguished between narrators whose unreliability stems from moral deficiency and those limited by intellectual or experiential constraints. Contemporary theorists, however, have complicated this taxonomy, arguing that all narration is inherently subjective and therefore, in some sense, unreliable. The poststructuralist critique goes further still, questioning whether the notion of "reliability" presupposes an objective truth that the text itself may not endorse. This theoretical shift has profound implications for how we read — and teach — literature, suggesting that the reader\'s task is not to penetrate the narrator\'s deceptions but to interrogate the very frameworks through which meaning is constructed.', questionText: 'What challenge does the poststructuralist critique pose to the concept of the unreliable narrator?', options: [{ label: 'It questions whether objective truth in a text even exists', value: 'It questions whether objective truth in a text even exists' }, { label: 'It argues that all narrators are deliberately deceptive', value: 'It argues that all narrators are deliberately deceptive' }, { label: 'It claims that readers cannot understand narration', value: 'It claims that readers cannot understand narration' }, { label: 'It proves that Booth\'s theory was wrong', value: 'It proves that Booth\'s theory was wrong' }], correctAnswer: 'It questions whether objective truth in a text even exists', points: 3, orderIndex: 36 },
