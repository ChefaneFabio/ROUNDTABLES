## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify SMTP configuration
cat .env | grep SMTP

# Check notification table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE status = 'FAILED';"

# Check server logs
tail -f server.log | grep -i "email"
```

**Solution**:
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` to enable actual email sending
- Verify SMTP credentials are correct
- Check SMTP server allows connections

### Issue: Voting Token Invalid

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify token exists
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM voting_tokens WHERE token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';"

# Check expiration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT expires_at < NOW() as expired FROM voting_tokens WHERE token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';"

# Check if used
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT used_at FROM voting_tokens WHERE token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';"
```

**Solution**:
- Generate new tokens if expired
- Tokens are single-use only
- Check roundtable status is TOPIC_VOTING

### Issue: Automated Jobs Not Running

**Check**:
```bash
# Check server logs for scheduler initialization
grep "Job scheduler initialized" server.log

# Check if cron jobs are running
grep "Checking for trainer reminders" server.log
```

**Solution**:
- Ensure server is running continuously
- Check server time zone matches expectations
- Verify cron syntax in scheduler.ts
